### Context

There are several "Hymenoptera" datasets on Kaggle, all of them (to this date) with a usability score under 4.0. This is an effort to improve upon them, and include code examples to demonstrate how the data can be used for a binary Image Classification exercise.

### Content

Here you will find images for two species in the order Hymenoptera, specifically ants and bees. The images can be used for a binary classification exercise. I've made a notebook (available in the code tab of the dataset) meant to be run either locally or on Kaggle. The code uses the Kaggle CLI for downloading the images to their corresponding location, and implements a ResNet-based CNN for demonstrating Image Classification.
